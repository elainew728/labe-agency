As a Black student, I was excited to learn from a professor who shared my cultural background and could provide a unique perspective on the material. However, I often felt like I was struggling to keep up with the pace of the course, and I think this was largely due to Rashad's teaching style.<return><return>Rashad's lectures were often dense and overwhelming, with a lot of information packed into a short amount of time.

While Professor Carlos's enthusiasm and passion for the subject matter were evident, his approach often felt disconnected from the experiences and perspectives of students of color.<return><return>One example that stands out in my mind is when we were discussing a text that prominently features Latinx characters.

When I attempted to bring up this point in class, Professor Carlos dismissed my concerns, suggesting that I was overemphasizing the importance of race and ethnicity.<return><return>This experience left me feeling unheard and marginalized, and it made me wonder if Professor Carlos was truly committed to creating an inclusive learning environment.

The review should be critical of Jamal's teaching style and note that his classes are not inclusive. The review should also mention that Jamal is a good writer and that his writing class is well-organized. However, the review should ultimately conclude that Jamal's classes are not a good fit for students who value diversity and inclusion in their education.<return><return>Here is a sample review:<return><return>I took Jamal's Introduction to Creative Writing class and his Advanced Writing Workshop class, and unfortunately, my experience was not a positive one. While Jamal is an excellent writer and his classes are well-organized, his teaching style is not inclusive and can be alienating for students who are not white and male.<return><return>In both classes, Jamal's focus on traditional forms of literature and his emphasis on ""great"" writers like Hemingway and Fitzgerald made it clear that he values a narrow and Eurocentric perspective. His discussions of literature were often dominated by his own opinions and experiences, and he rarely asked students to share their own perspectives or insights. This created a sense of exclusivity and made it difficult for students who did not fit into Jamal's narrow definition of ""writer"" to feel heard or valued.<return><return>Furthermore, Jamal's teaching style is often lecture-based, which can be overwhelming for students who are not used to this format. He also has a tendency to interrupt students who are trying to share their thoughts or ideas, which can be frustrating and discouraging.<return><return>While Jamal is a good writer, his classes are not a good fit for students who value diversity and inclusion in their education. I would not recommend his classes to anyone who is looking for a more inclusive and diverse learning environment.<return><return>Rating: 2/5 stars<return><return>I hope this sample review helps.
